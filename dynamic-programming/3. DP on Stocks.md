Here, I have to calculate the most profit. To do that, I store the 0th element of the array in the 'mini' variable. I don't store any array value in 'maxi' as the condition is that maxi is always gonna be to the right of 'mini', i.e., the index will be greater. And maxi > mini ofcourse. 
So whenever I update 'mini', I also update maxi as 0, as now a new maxi needs to be calculated to the right of the new mini. And the maximum difference between maxi and mini is stored in 'profit'.

Here, I have the option to buy and sell stocks multiple times, but can hold only on share of stock at a time. So I simply compare successive elements, and whenever there is a profit, I add it to the 'profit' variable. 

==Using DP== : 
This question can have a recursive solution as well, where I can always have two choices at index, either I can buy/sell the stock, or choose to not do so. So, as we have multiple choices, we use recursion. Following is the code:

Here, we use 2 variables, i.e. ind & buy. 'ind' is used to indicate the index where we are currently, and 'buy' indicates if we hold a stock currently or not, i.e. if we can buy the current stock or not, as we can only buy a stock if we have sold the previous stock we bought or haven't bought one yet.
Now, whenever we buy a stock, we put minus in front of it, whereas if we sell a stock, we put plus. It's simple. Whenever we buy, we lose, and when we sell, we gain. Profit = Sell - Buy, and hence cost of selling is taken to be positive and cost of buying is considered negative.  In each function call, according to the value of the variable 'buy', we either execute the 'if(buy)' statement or the 'else' statement. Within those statements, ```if(buy==1)```,
