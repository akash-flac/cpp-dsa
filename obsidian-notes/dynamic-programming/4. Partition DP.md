Partitioning an array into multiple partitions so as to find the optimal partition of the array in case of a given condition.

**Pattern Identification:** Whenever we need to find the answer to a large problem such that the problem can be broken into subproblems and the final answer varies due to the **order** in which the subproblems are solved, we can think in terms of partition DP.

Example:

Rules :
1. Start with the entire block/array. Represent them using i & j, i being the 'start' and j being the 'end'. Then state the base case.
2. Try all partitions.
	1. Run a loop to try all partitions.
3. Return the best possible 2 partitions.

==Solution== : 

- Recursion + Memoization

- Tabulation
	1. Copy the base case
	2. Write down changing states
	3.  Copy the recurrence
 
 Here, 'i' will go from n-1 to 0(as i moves from 0 to n-1 in the recursion),
 and 'j' will go from i+1 to n-1(moves from n-1 towards 0 in the recursion, that is why 0 to n-1 in tabulation, but as j is always greater than or equal to i+1, we move from i+1 to n-1).
