A spanning tree of a graph consists of all nodes of the graph and some of the edges of the graph so that there is a path between any two nodes. Like trees in general, spanning trees are connected and acyclic.

The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of its edge weights. For example, the weight of the above spanning tree is 3+5+9+3+2 = 22.

A **minimum spanning tree** is a spanning tree whose weight is as small as possible. The weight of a minimum spanning tree for the example graph is 20
