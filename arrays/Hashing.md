- prestoring/fetching
- int hash array
	- max hash array size
		- inside main function: 10^6
		- globally : 10^7
- character hash array :
	- can do `ch - 'a'` to map characters to a hash array of size 26(0-25 indices)
	- else, if the range of characters is not known, just make a hash array of size 256 as there are 256 characters and the character will automatically be mapped to the correct index based on its ASCII value
- use stl : map/unordered_map
	- time complexity of map: storing/fetching takes O(n) in all cases(best, worst, avg)
	- time complexity of map: 
		- storing/fetching - O(1) in for avg and best cases, but O(n) for worst case
- hashing theory
	- division method
	- chaining
